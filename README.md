# PLA-GAN
This is the code for "LOW-DOSE CT RECONSTRCTION VIA OPTIMIZATION-INSPIRED GAN", currently submitting to icassp. The complete code will be uploaded after the review phase. The comparisons with state-of-the-arts on the Mayo dataset validate the superiority of our proposed algorithm both numerically and visually. The advantages of generalizability and interpretability are also evident. If you you encounter any doubts, please fell free to concact us: jjw@zjut.edu.cn or zjw@zjut.edu.cn
